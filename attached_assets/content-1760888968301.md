## What We Offer

### Cyber Security Specialist as a Service

The Cyber Security Specialist as a Service offering is designed for organisations who require regular cyber and information security support but aren't ready for a full time hire. A cyber security specialist can take a number of everyday tasks off your shoulders, including your customer's security questionnaires, compliance guidance and supplier reviews; they can act as a security SME for both your technical and non-technical staff. All for a fraction of the price and effort of hiring an employee full time.

### Bespoke training

We offer individually designed cyber security training for your employees. With years of experience in education and science communication, we can make security training engaging, informative and memorable.

Topics include, but aren't limited to:

- annual information security training

- OWASP Top 10 training for developers

- information security for sales


### Architecture Security Review

We specialise in AWS security and can help you review your SaaS product's architecture to ensure you follow security best practice.

### Security Maturity Assessment

We can help you assess the current level of your organisation's cyber security maturity against industry standards (e.g. NIST) and provide a clear, feasible and realistic plan on how to improve.

### Media Consulting

Writing a book, a podcast or a TV show and need a sense check on a technology or cyber security related topic? We can help you ensure your content is technologically correct while staying entertaining and accessible.
