Quality Gates
-------------
• Lighthouse: target ≥90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO.
• No client‑side secrets.
• Server validates and sanitizes input; logs errors meaningfully.
• 404 page and basic error boundary.
• Clear CTAs on every section (“Book an intro call”, “Request proposal”).
 IMPORTANT
---------
• If a logo is not present, ask the user to upload one and show a placeholder in the meantime.
• Default theme must be dark.
• Keep content editable and organized so the founder can easily adjust packages, case studies, and blog posts later.
