## Technical documents

The requirements to be met under each of the 5 technical controls can be found in the current Requirements for IT infrastructure document.

The latest versions are effective from 28 April 2025. All applications from this date should use version 3.2 of the documents which are linked below, and are also available from the [Downloads section](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/resources#end) on this page.
